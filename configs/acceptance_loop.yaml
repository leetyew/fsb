# Acceptance loop simulation config
# Based on paper Appendix C.1 and Section 6.1
#
# Per paper: runs for all n_periods without early stopping.
# BASL labeling has its own early stopping via max_iterations (jmax).

n_periods: 500            # Number of lending iterations (paper: 500)
batch_size: 100           # n: applicants per period
target_accept_rate: 0.15  # α: acceptance rate
initial_batch_size: 100   # Bootstrap batch size
x_v_feature: "x0"         # Feature for initial acceptance (before model exists)
random_seed: 42
